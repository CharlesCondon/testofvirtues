# Test of Virtues
This is a website project to recreate the classic "Rice Purity Test" site with a more modern aesthetic and updated questions.
The main design focus on this site centered around neomorphism and minimalism. Together, with updated logic as well, the new
site is much more fitting for modern day users. 

Google Analytics is also utilized on the site to gather anonymous scores from users in order to later analyze.

Notes:
Further optimizations can be made in a few areas in the site. The javascript for index page can be rewritten using .hide() and
.show() functions rather than adding and removing css classes which should slightly improve code readability. However, most, if 
not all, optimization changes would primarily be for readability rather than speed.
